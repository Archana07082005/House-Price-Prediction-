# House-Price-Prediction-
House Price Prediction using Linear Regression

## Description
This project uses machine learning to predict house prices based on:
- Area (in sqft)
- Number of Bedrooms
- Age of the house (in years)

## Features
- Trains a linear regression model
- Evaluates using Mean Squared Error
- Predicts price for a custom input

## Libraries Used
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to Run
1. Install required libraries:
   `pip install pandas scikit-learn`

2. Run the script:
   `python house_price_predictor.py`

3. Youâ€™ll get:
   - Model accuracy (Mean Squared Error)
   - Predicted price of a sample new house
